# N-Queens Genetic Algorithm
A genetic algorithm implementation of the classic N-Queens problem, written in Python. The N-Queens problem is a well-known problem in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence, which involves placing N queens on an NxN chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.

## Installation
To use this project, you'll need to have Python 3 and pip installed on your machine. Then, you can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
To run the algorithm and see the solution for an NxN chessboard, you can use the command line interface as follows:

```python genetic_algorithm.py```

The above command will run the algorithm and print out the solution for an 8x8 chessboard. You can also specify the population size, mutation rate, and number of generations by passing additional arguments to the script.
Results
The algorithm will run and produce one or more solution, if found, that satisfy the n-queens problem, you can display them in a chessboard form to see the result.

## Contributions
This is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome. If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue on GitHub.
